# password-generator
#### Author: Hai Duong

### Assigment objectives:
- Learn how to work with Array data type (create and retrieve data in array)
- Learn how to work with built-in Array methods such as ```.concat()```, ```.push()``` 
- Learn how to create and work with Javascript functions in a functional structure - breaking down main problem/task into managable and reusable block of code (smaller functions)
- Demonstrate currying with function
- Demonstrate how to work with loop and conditional flow

### Procedues the app/webpage:
1. User click ```Generate Password``` button
2. Website prompt user about password's length with ```prompt()```
3. The app validate user's input to see if it is
    - a number type? 
    - a number in range 8 - 128 ?
    - if one of the above validation fail, return a String that says why it went wrong.
    - if the validation pass, go to ```step 4```
4. Then the app asks/prompts user about chararacter sets to be used for password ```confirm()```
    - upercase character set
    - lowercase charater set
    - number character set
    - special character set

5. Validate if the user picks at least one character set in ```step 4```. Otherwise, repeat ```step 4```.

6. Once user's inputs are validated, the app will generate an ``` character pool Array``` that contains charcters, which meet ```step 4```'s requirement. 
7. The app will generate a random index number based on ```character pool Array```'s length 
8. The app will use index number from ```step 7``` to pick a random character from ```charcter pool Array``` and add that random character into a ```password string```
9. Repeat ```step 7``` and ```step 8``` with ```password's length``` times
10. Return a final password string
11. Provided code will display the final password string on the textarea box

### Functions that are created in the app
- `charLookup(start, end)` 
    - Generate and return an Array of characters of range [`start` - `end`] on the ASCII table
    - We used it to generate uppercase/lowercase/number/special char arrays 

- `acceptableArrayGenerator()`
    - This prompts user about type of character set will be added to `characer pool Array`
    - This will return an Array which is used as character pool
    - If user didn't pick one of the type, it will curry/re-call itself until users pick one

-  `generatePassword()`
    - This will prompt and validate user about Password's length
    - After the input is validated:
        - declare a password string (empty)
        - It will pick a random character by using `random index number` on character pool Array (generated by `acceptableArrayGenerator()`)
        - It will add that random character to password string
        - repeat the pick and add steps `password's length` times
    - After the loop is done, return the password string  
- `writePassword()`
    - stores the password string that `generatePassword()` created
    - targets an element with ID on HTML to display
    - updates the element's innerHTML/value with password string

### Call stack
1. `charLookup()` got called 4 times first to genenrate the char type arrays as global variables
2. When user click `Generate` button: 
    - the `writePassword()` gets called
        -  the `generatePassword()` get called and propmpt user for pass length
                - the `acceptableArrayGenerator()` get called and prompts user for data types
                - specific type arrays are added to `Character Pool Array`
                - return `Character Pool Array`
        - picking and adding random character into `password string`
        - return `password string`
    - target the HTML element
    - update the element value/innerHTML with `password string`
